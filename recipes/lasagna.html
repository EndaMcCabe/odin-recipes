        <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg" alt="A picture of a slice of Lasagna">
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish characterized by its rich layers of flavor and texture. It typically consists of sheets of pasta, often made fresh or dried, layered with a savory filling that usually includes a combination of ground meat (like beef or sausage), ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and a robust tomato sauce. These ingredients are seasoned with herbs such as basil and oregano, adding depth to each bite.

                    <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
