        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish characterized by its rich layers of flavor and texture. It typically consists of sheets of pasta, often made fresh or dried, layered with a savory filling that usually includes a combination of ground meat (like beef or sausage), ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and a robust tomato sauce. These ingredients are seasoned with herbs such as basil and oregano, adding depth to each bite.
