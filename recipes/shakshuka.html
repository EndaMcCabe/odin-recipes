        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper (red or green), chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground paprika</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground chili powder or red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes or fresh ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4-6 large eggs</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Optional: Crumbled feta cheese, olives, or avocado (for toppings)</li>
            <li>Bread (such as pita or crusty bread, for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>    Heat olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and slightly golden.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add Garlic and Spices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir in the garlic, cumin, paprika, and chili powder. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly to release the flavors of the spices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add Tomatoes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes. If using fresh tomatoes, you might need to simmer a bit longer to break them down. Season with salt and pepper. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. Stir occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make Wells for the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the sauce has thickened, use a spoon to make small wells in the tomato mixture. Gently crack the eggs one by one into each well, being careful not to break the yolks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Poach the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook on low heat for 5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are set to your desired doneness. For runny yolks, check after 5 minutes; for firmer yolks, cook longer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Garnish and Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the eggs are done, remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle with fresh parsley or cilantro and any optional toppings like feta cheese or olives.</li>
                    <li>Serve the shakshuka hot, with warm bread on the side to scoop up the sauce and eggs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
